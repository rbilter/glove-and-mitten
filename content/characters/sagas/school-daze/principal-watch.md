### Background Story

"Principal Watch" wasn't a name Watch ever expected to be called, but sometimes life works out in unexpected ways. Growing up, Watch dreamed of playing professional sports. While not the most naturally athletic, Watch possessed exceptional precision, organization, data analysis skills, and an uncanny ability to synchronize with any situation.

These unique attributes aligned well with Watch's athletic dreams, leading to countless hours spent working out, running speed drills, memorizing different strategies, and analyzing statistics—all in hopes of earning a scholarship to a major college and eventually making it to the professional leagues.

Phase one of Watch's plan succeeded when Accessory University offered a full scholarship. However, there was one requirement: Watch would also need to pursue a degree in education. This was a program the university offered to athletes, providing an alternative career path in case sports dreams didn't materialize. Little did Watch know this decision would completely transform their future.

Just as with athletics, Watch dedicated all free time to making the starting team. But something unexpected happened during education classes—Watch was deeply moved by the professors' passion for teaching. Seeing how each educator loved their area of expertise and how this dedication transferred to students created a pivotal moment.

It was then that Watch decided to abandon the professional sports dream and dedicate all energy to becoming an educator, recognizing this was where the biggest impact on society could be made. While Watch still loves sports and spends time playing and coaching, they couldn't imagine being called anything but "Principal Watch."
