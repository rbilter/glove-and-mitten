### Background Story

Mitten has always been a free spirit, allowing Fingers and Hand to freely mingle and socializeâ€”this open, welcoming approach has shaped Mitten's entire worldview. Mitten is constantly looking to try new activities, pursue fresh ideas, and hopes to bring at least one smile to every Accessory each day.

Mitten thrives in social situations: days spent exploring, connecting with friends, trying new experiences, and evenings sharing those adventures with followers across social media platforms. With a devoted online community, Mitten genuinely cares about keeping everyone engaged and happy, seeing social media not as self-promotion but as a way to spread joy and connection.

Everything changed on one terrible day when Mitten's social media accounts explodedâ€”but for all the wrong reasons. Fans and subscribers were turning hostile, and scrolling through the comments revealed the devastating cause: a post in big bold letters that read "I'M DONE KEEPING YOU DRONES HAPPY, THIS WILL BE MY LAST POST, GO WASTE YOUR TIME ELSEWHERE, I'M NO LONGER YOUR MUSE!" 

As the shock subsided, Mitten realized the horrible truthâ€”all accounts had been hacked! Someone had deliberately sabotaged everything Mitten had worked to build.

Needing a clear head to think, Mitten decided to escape to the libraryâ€”a quiet place to process everything that had happened. Overwhelmed by questions: How did this happen? Who would want to hurt me? How can I fix this? Will I lose everything I've built? While searching for a secluded spot to sit and think, Mitten spotted a handwritten sign on a corner table: "Any Case Welcome - Glove, Security Specialist."

With no other options, a distraught Mitten approached Glove's improvised "office" at the library table, not knowing this moment would transform both their lives forever.
