-   The School-Daze saga should be focused on stories around any school
    > type setting, activity, etc. The setting doesn't have to be at a
    > school as long as the setting revolves around a school activity
    > like a school bus or school field trip for example.

-   The stories need to describe the settings making sure to include
    > background information that would make the readers understand the
    > school setting.

-   All background art work will need to convey the school setting and
    > of course go along with the dialog for the scene.

-   We could think about some new characters we could introduce to the
    > series but those characters should make sense for a school setting
    > and would only be used in this saga. Some examples would be
    > Pencil/Pen, Beaker, Test tube.
