# Project Setup Workflow

## Overview
Documents the initial project setup for the Glove and Mitten creative project, including folder structure, workflows, and automation setup.

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - This workflow has been fully executed for this project.

## What Was Accomplished
This workflow established:

### 1. Project Structure
- **39 directories** organized by purpose
- **Assets** folder with images, audio, templates
- **Characters** folder with main/saga-specific organization  
- **Stories** folder with ideas and completed episodes
- **Production** folder with hybrid Git+Google Drive workflow

### 2. Version Control
- Git repository initialized
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` protecting creative assets
- All source files tracked and committed

### 3. Automation Workflows
- **process-episode** - PowerPoint to YouTube metadata
- **sync-project** - Git and Google Drive synchronization
- **Makefile interface** - Simple command execution

### 4. Documentation
- README.md with project overview
- project-structure.md with detailed organization
- series-bible.md with character rules and world-building
- Workflow documents for all automation

### 5. Content Integration
- Episode 01 "Tuff Daze" fully integrated
- Complete metadata package generated
- All assets organized and accessible

## Reference Commands Used

### Initial Setup
```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

### Structure Creation
```bash
mkdir -p assets/{images,audio,templates}
mkdir -p characters/{main,sagas}
mkdir -p stories/{ideas,sagas}
mkdir -p production/{completed,in-progress}
```

### Google Drive Integration
```bash
rclone config  # Configure Google Drive connection
rclone sync . gdrive:glove-and-mitten --exclude .git/
```

## Future Projects
For new creative projects, use this workflow as a template:

1. **Review this setup** for applicable patterns
2. **Adapt folder structure** to project needs
3. **Implement automation** using proven workflows
4. **Document everything** for team collaboration

## Notes
- This setup supports both solo and collaborative work
- Hybrid Git+Google Drive strategy balances version control with file sharing
- Automation reduces manual metadata creation work
- Structure scales from single episodes to multi-saga universes
