**User:**
> Let's work on task 3

**Copilot:**
> Perfect! Let's work on **Task 3: Interactive Audio Player Controls**. First, let me check the current TTS implementation to understand how audio playback is currently handled. Let me see more of the file, particularly the audio playback section: Now let me check what audio players are available on the system and explore options for interactive audio control: Good! We have `mpg123`, `ffplay`, and `aplay`. Let me check if `vlc` is available and if not, we can install it or use `mpv` which is light...

**User:**
> let's do task 4

**Copilot:**
> Perfect! Let's work on **Task 4: Auto-open files in editor when reading them**.

The goal is to automatically open the character file in VS Code when the TTS script reads it, so you can follow along with the audio.

Let me first examine the current and methods to see where to add the editor integration: Let me also check the config structure to see if I should add an editor option there: Let me see the rest of the config structure: Now I'll implement the editor auto-opening feature. I'll:

**Copilot:**
> I see the issue! The error is happening because I switched back to using the direct dictionary access instead of the safer `.get()` method. Let me check the current state of the file and fix it: I can see that I did fix it to use `.get()` with a default value. However, the error might be occurring because there's still a config override line that uses direct access. Let me check where the config overrides are handled: Ah! The issue is in the override section. When we try to set , the key doesn't...

**User:**
> how do I access the audio player? I don't see it in the terminal

**Copilot:**
> The audio player (MPV) is running in a separate process in the background! Here's how to access and control it:

## 🎮 **How to Control the Audio Player**

### **Option 1: Find the MPV Window**
MPV should have opened in its own window. Look for:
- A window titled with the audio filename (like )
- It might be minimized or behind other windows
- Check your taskbar/dock for the MPV application

### **Option 2: Use Terminal Commands to Control MPV**
Let me show you how to interact with the running MP...

**User:**
> looks like you got stuck running the last command

**Copilot:**
> You're right! Let me help you find and control the audio player. The MPV audio player is running in the background, but it might not be visible. Here are the ways to access it: I can see you have 3 MPV instances running! Here's how to control them:

## 🎮 **Audio Player Control Options**

### **Method 1: Find the MPV Terminal Window**
Since we used `--term-osd-bar`, MPV should be running in terminal windows. Look for:
- Terminal windows that might be minimized or in the background
- The most rece...

**User:**
> let's try 1 first

**Copilot:**
> Perfect! Let's stop all current audio and restart with better visibility. First, let me stop the existing MPV instances: Good! Now let me verify they're all stopped: Excellent! All audio players are now stopped. Now let me improve the MPV launch to make it more visible and accessible. I'll modify the script to launch MPV in a new terminal window that you can easily see and interact with: ``` ``` Now let's test the improved audio player with better visibility: Perfect! 🎉 The audio player should n...

**User:**
> that worked perfect

**Copilot:**
> Excellent! 🎉 I'm so glad the new terminal window approach worked perfectly for you. Now you have full control over the audio playback while being able to follow along with the character file that automatically opened in VS Code.

**User:**
> let's sync

**Copilot:**
> Perfect! Let's sync our progress to both Git and Google Drive. We've made significant improvements to the TTS system and should save our work. Let me try a different approach: Let me check if we're in a git repository and what changes we have: Great! I can see we have one modified file. Let me check what changes we've made: Perfect! This shows all our improvements. Now let's commit and sync: Excellent! Now let's push to GitHub: Great! Now let's sync to Google Drive: Perfect! Let's verify the syn...
