# Session Baseline Summary - July 21, 2025
*Complete project status as of end of July 21st session*

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Repository**: glove-and-mitten (rbilter/glove-and-mitten)
- **Branch**: main
- **Last Commit**: 5bd8ae9 - Complete Tasks 3 & 4: Interactive Audio Controls + Auto-Editor Opening
- **Project Focus**: TTS system enhancements for Glove & Mitten character profiles

## ✅ Completed Tasks (All Complete as of July 21st)

### Task 1: Audio File Exclusions ✅
- **Status**: Complete
- **Problem**: TTS cache files being committed to Git and synced to Drive
- **Solution**: Added exclusions to `.gitignore` and `.rclone-filter`
- **Files Modified**: `.gitignore`, `.rclone-filter`
- **Outcome**: Cache files properly excluded, no more repository bloat
- **Location**: Audio cache at `dev/cache/audio-cache/` with `tts-*.mp3` patterns

### Task 2: Folder Reorganization ✅
- **Status**: Complete
- **Problem**: Flat project structure mixing content types
- **Solution**: Implemented three-tier structure
- **Structure Created**:
  - `content/` - Creative assets (characters, series bible, stories)
  - `dev/` - Development tools, scripts, configs, cache
  - `production/` - Final deliverables and exports
- **Files Reorganized**: All character profiles, scripts, configs moved to appropriate locations
- **Outcome**: Clean separation, improved organization, successful Google Drive sync

### Task 3: Interactive Audio Player Controls ✅
- **Status**: Complete  
- **Problem**: Audio playback blocked script execution, no user control during playback
- **Solution**: MPV integration with non-blocking terminal window launch
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Replaced blocking `subprocess.run()` with `subprocess.Popen()`
  - Added MPV detection and multi-terminal support (gnome-terminal, konsole, xfce4-terminal, xterm)
  - Implemented fallback chain: MPV → traditional players (mpg123, ffplay, etc.)
  - Added comprehensive user controls and process tracking
- **User Controls Available**:
  - SPACE = pause/play toggle
  - LEFT/RIGHT arrows = seek backward/forward  
  - +/- = volume up/down
  - Q = quit player
- **Files Modified**: `dev/scripts/read-profile.py` (major rewrite of audio system)
- **Outcome**: Full interactive control, script remains responsive, background audio management

### Task 4: Auto-Open Files in Editor ✅
- **Status**: Complete
- **Problem**: Manual file opening required for follow-along reading
- **Solution**: Integrated VS Code auto-opening with TTS playback
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added `auto_open_editor: true` to TTS configuration  
  - Created `open_in_editor()` method with VS Code detection
  - Implemented fallback to system default editor (xdg-open)
  - Added `--no-editor` command line flag for user control
  - Enhanced config merging with deep merge for nested dictionaries
- **User Experience**: Files automatically open in VS Code when TTS begins reading
- **Files Modified**: `dev/scripts/read-profile.py` (config and editor integration)
- **Outcome**: Seamless reading experience, configurable behavior, maintains backward compatibility

  - google-cloud-texttospeech (2.27.0)
  - Standard library: pathlib, subprocess, json, hashlib, argparse, re, glob
- **Audio Players**: MPV (primary), mpg123, ffplay, aplay (fallbacks)
- **System Integration**: VS Code, various terminal emulators

### Data & Sync Infrastructure  
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub repository
- **Cloud Backup**: rclone sync to Google Drive `gdrive:glove-and-mitten`
- **File Filtering**: Comprehensive exclusions for cache, temp files
- **Content Preservation**: All creative assets (.md, .png, .mp3, .pptx, .docx) tracked

## 📋 Content Inventory (Available Characters)
- **Main Characters**:
  - `glove` - School Security Specialist & Problem Solver
  - `mitten` - Social Media Enthusiast & Heart of the Community  
  - `fingers-and-hand` - Supporting character
- **School-Daze Saga Characters**:
  - `instructor-beaker` - Science Teacher & Experiment Enthusiast
  - `principal-watch` - School authority figure
- **Templates**: `character-profile-template` for new character creation

## 🔧 System Capabilities & User Experience

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Basic usage
python dev/scripts/read-profile.py [character-name]

# Available options
--voice VOICE          # Specify TTS voice (e.g., en-US-Neural2-D)
--no-play             # Don't auto-play audio (save only)
--no-editor           # Don't auto-open file in editor
--list-voices         # Show available TTS voices
--list-characters     # Show available character files
--test-mode          # Process text without TTS API calls
```

### User Experience Flow
1. **Command Execution**: User runs script with character name
2. **File Discovery**: Auto-finds character file using fuzzy matching
3. **Editor Opening**: VS Code automatically opens character file
4. **Text Processing**: Markdown cleaned, chunked if needed
5. **Audio Generation**: TTS synthesis with caching
6. **Audio Playback**: MPV launches in new terminal with full controls
7. **Concurrent Access**: Script remains responsive for additional commands

### Technical Features
- **Smart Caching**: Avoids re-generating identical audio
- **Chunk Processing**: Handles long character profiles automatically
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and clear error messages
- **Configuration**: JSON-based config with automatic merging
- **Cross-Platform**: Terminal detection and audio player fallbacks
