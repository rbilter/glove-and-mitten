# Conversation Summary System

## 📋 Overview
This directory tracks conversation summaries using a delta-based approach to maintain context across multi-day development sessions. The system runs automatically every night and intelligently detects whether development work occurred.

## 🤖 Automated Operation
- **Schedule**: Runs automatically at 11:50 PM daily via cron job
- **Detection**: Analyzes git activity (commits, changes) to determine session type
- **Generation**: Creates appropriate summary based on detected activity
- **Logging**: Writes execution logs to `/tmp/daily-session-summary.log`

## 🗂️ File Structure

### Baseline Files
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-session-baseline.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete project status snapshot
- **Created**: Periodically (weekly/monthly) or after major milestones
- **Content**: Full context including completed tasks, system status, file structure, technical decisions

### Delta Files  
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-session-delta.md`
- **Purpose**: Incremental changes since last baseline
- **Created**: Automatically each day by cron job
- **Content**: Session activity, file changes, decisions, problems solved, next steps

## 📝 What Gets Tracked

### Baseline Summaries Include:
- ✅ **Task Completion**: Full status and outcomes for all completed tasks
- 🛠️ **Technical Infrastructure**: System capabilities, dependencies, configurations
- 📁 **Project Structure**: Directory organization and key file locations
- 🎯 **Problem Resolution**: Issues encountered and solutions implemented
- 📊 **Development Metrics**: Commit history, files modified, features added
- 🔧 **System Status**: Current capabilities and ready-for-development state

### Delta Summaries Include:
- 🔄 **Session Activity**: Focus areas and work accomplished
- � **Git Activity**: Commits made, files modified, repository changes
- 💭 **Decisions Made**: Technical choices and problem-solving approaches
- 💡 **Ideas Discussed**: New concepts and implementation strategies
- ⏭️ **Next Steps**: Goals and action items for future sessions
- 🚫 **No-Session Days**: Recorded when no development activity detected

## 🎯 System Benefits
- **Context Preservation**: Never lose track of where you left off
- **Decision Documentation**: Record why technical choices were made
- **Progress Tracking**: See incremental development over time
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Easy handoff between sessions or team members
- **Problem Prevention**: Avoid re-solving the same issues
- **Automated Capture**: No manual intervention required for basic tracking

## 📊 Usage Workflow

### Automated Daily Process
1. **11:50 PM**: Cron job executes summary script
2. **Git Analysis**: Checks for commits and changes made today
3. **Session Detection**: Determines if development work occurred
4. **Summary Creation**: Generates appropriate delta file
5. **File Management**: Updates existing files or creates new ones

### Manual Interaction
1. **Start Session**: Read latest baseline + recent deltas for context
2. **During Session**: System automatically tracks git activity
3. **End Session**: Optionally add manual details to today's delta file
4. **Periodic**: Create new baseline after major milestones

### Management Commands
```bash
# Check system status
./dev/scripts/setup-daily-summaries.sh status

# Test summary generation
./dev/scripts/setup-daily-summaries.sh test

# Install/remove automation
./dev/scripts/setup-daily-summaries.sh install
./dev/scripts/setup-daily-summaries.sh remove
```

## 🔧 Technical Integration
- **Version Control**: Files stored in Git for complete history
- **Cloud Backup**: Synced to Google Drive for redundancy
- **TTS Compatible**: Markdown files can be read by TTS system for audio review
- **Automated Detection**: Git activity analysis for intelligent session classification
- **Smart Updates**: Existing files updated without overwriting manual content

## 🎛️ Session Types

### Active Session Delta
Created when git activity (commits or changes) detected:
- Captures all git activity with commit details
- Provides template sections for manual additions
- Includes repository status and file modification summary
- Tracks technical progress automatically

### No-Session Delta  
Created when no development activity detected:
- Records "no session" status for completeness
- Shows repository state and last activity
- Maintains continuity in daily tracking
- Prevents gaps in session history

## 🔄 Baseline Generation
New baselines should be created:
- **After Major Milestones**: Completion of significant features or tasks
- **Weekly/Monthly**: For regular comprehensive snapshots
- **Before Major Changes**: Prior to significant architecture modifications
- **Manual Creation**: When current baseline becomes too outdated

*This automated system ensures development continuity and knowledge preservation across all sessions, with zero manual overhead for basic tracking.*
