## Structure Overview

This project uses a **separated concerns** approach with three main areas:

### ðŸŽ­ Creative Content (`content/`)
All creative assets, character definitions, and story content organized for easy navigation and collaboration.

### ðŸŽ¬ Final Deliverables (`production/`)
Complete episodes ready for YouTube upload, with metadata tracking and video files managed via hybrid Git + Google Drive workflow.

### ðŸ”§ Development Tools (`dev/`)
Scripts, automation, configuration, and documentation for the technical development process.
