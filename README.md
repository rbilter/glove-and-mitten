# Glove and Mitten

A creative project for developing YouTube episodes featuring the characters Glove and Mitten in their adventures.

## Getting Started

1. Read [Series Bible](content/series-bible.md) for character guidelines
2. Explore [Project Structure](dev/docs/project-structure.md) for organization
3. Use natural language commands with AI assistant for automation
4. Start creating episodes using saga templates in `content/stories/sagas/`

## Project Overview

This repository contains all source materials, workflows, and production assets for creating educational and entertaining episodes featuring:
- **Glove** - Methodical problem-solver and self-appointed security specialist
- **Mitten** - Warm-hearted social media enthusiast and community builder  
- **Supporting Cast** - Principal Watch, Instructor Beaker, and the "Mittenites"

## Quick Start

### Creating New Episodes
1. **Create PowerPoint** using saga templates in `content/stories/sagas/[saga]/`
2. **Run process-episode** workflow to generate YouTube metadata
3. **Export final video** to `production/completed/videos/`

### Automation Commands
```bash
# Natural language commands with AI assistant (recommended)
"commit-local"              # Commit changes and sync to Google Drive  
"process-episode: [path]"   # Process episode for metadata generation
"read-profile [character]"  # Text-to-speech for character profiles
"help"                      # Show all available commands
"status"                    # Show project status

# Direct workflow access
dev/workflows/process-episode.md     # Episode processing workflow
dev/workflows/commit-local.md        # Git + GitHub + Google Drive sync
dev/workflows/text-to-speech.md     # TTS character profile reading
```

## Project Structure

### üìÅ Core Directories
- **`content/characters/`** - Character definitions (main cast + saga-specific)  
- **`content/stories/`** - Episode ideas and completed story arcs
- **`content/assets/`** - Images, audio, and templates organized by type
- **`production/`** - Final deliverables and YouTube metadata
- **`dev/workflows/`** - Automation documentation and processes
- **`dev/scripts/`** - TTS tools, chat automation, and workflow scripts
- **`dev/logs/`** - Automated conversation summaries and development tracking

### üé¨ Current Episodes
- **Episode 01: Lights - Tuff Daze** ‚úÖ Complete with metadata

## Workflows

### Episode Creation Process
1. **Develop Story** in `stories/ideas/` or use existing saga concepts
2. **Create Episode** using PowerPoint templates in `content/stories/sagas/[saga]/`  
3. **Process Episode** using automation workflow
4. **Export Video** and save to `production/completed/videos/`
5. **Upload to YouTube** using generated metadata

### Automation Workflows
- **[Process Episode](dev/workflows/process-episode.md)** - PowerPoint ‚Üí PDF ‚Üí YouTube metadata
- **[Commit Local](dev/workflows/commit-local.md)** - Git + GitHub + Google Drive sync
- **[Text-to-Speech](dev/workflows/text-to-speech.md)** - Character profile audio reading
- **[Chat Automation](dev/logs/conversation-summaries/README.md)** - Automated development session tracking

## Stats

- **50 directories** with organized creative and development assets
- **97 project files** including episodes, characters, documentation, and automation scripts
- **28 markdown files** for comprehensive documentation and session tracking
- **Hybrid workflow** combining Git version control with Google Drive cloud sync
- **Automated metadata** generation from actual episode content
- **GitHub integration** with SSH remote for collaboration
- **Chat automation** with VS Code integration for development session tracking
- **TTS system** for character profile audio generation using Google Cloud

## Development Workflow

1. **Create Episodes** using PowerPoint templates in saga directories
2. **Process Episodes** with "process-episode: [path]" to generate metadata
3. **Track Progress** via automated conversation summaries and session logs
4. **Commit Changes** with "commit-local" for Git + Google Drive sync
5. **Collaborate** via GitHub repository with automatic cloud backup

Ready to bring Glove and Mitten's adventures to life! üé¨
