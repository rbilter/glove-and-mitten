### Background Story

From a very young age, Glove always insisted on perfect order. Toys sorted by type and color, books organized by genre, author, and title, school supplies arranged with military precision—everything had its proper place. This natural organizational instinct wasn't just about neatness; Glove saw patterns and systems where others saw chaos.

The turning point came during a school movie night when Glove first saw "Men in Black." Watching Agent K methodically investigate alien mysteries with calm professionalism sparked something deep within. From that moment, Glove knew the calling: to be an agent who protects and serves, solving problems with systematic precision.

But instead of waiting for the CIA to call, Glove decided to start right where help was needed most—at Accessory Academy. Self-appointing as the school's unofficial "Security Specialist," Glove began treating every school challenge like a case to crack.

When mysterious situations arise—missing library books, cafeteria food mysteries, playground disputes—Glove springs into action with tablet in hand, ready to gather facts, interview witnesses, and solve the case methodically.

Everything changed the day Mitten walked into Glove's improvised "office" (a corner table in the library) with tears in her eyes and a problem that couldn't be solved with lists and logic alone. For the first time, Glove discovered that the most important cases aren't always about finding missing objects—sometimes they're about understanding missing feelings.

### Relationship Dynamics

**With Mitten**
Glove's systematic world was completely reorganized when Mitten entered the picture. While Glove approaches friendship like a case study—documenting Mitten's preferences, analyzing her communication patterns, trying to solve her problems—Mitten teaches Glove that the best relationships aren't problems to be solved, but experiences to be shared.

**With Accessories**
Glove treats all accessories as fellow community members deserving of professional attention and support. Whether working with authority figures like Principal Watch and Instructor Beaker on official school matters, or helping fellow students solve playground disputes and social mysteries, Glove approaches every interaction with genuine desire to help and methodical attention to wellbeing. Sometimes others are bemused by Glove's intensity, but they appreciate the careful attention to community safety and systematic problem-solving approach.
